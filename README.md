# Drowsiness Detection System using Eye Aspect Ratio

## Overview

This Python script implements a drowsiness detection system using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) technique. The script uses the dlib library for face detection and facial landmarks extraction, and OpenCV for video capture and visualization. It also utilizes Pygame's mixer module to play an alert sound when drowsiness is detected.

## Dependencies

- [dlib](http://dlib.net/)
- [imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils)
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install dlib
pip install imutils
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

1. **Download the pre-trained facial landmarks model:**
   - Download the model file from http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
   - Extract the contents and place the "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" file in the "models" directory.

2. **Download an alert sound:**
   - Download a sound file (e.g., "music.wav") that will be played as an alert when drowsiness is detected.
   - Place the sound file in the same directory as the script.

3. **Run the script:**
   - Execute the script using a Python interpreter:
     ```bash
     python drowsiness_detection.py
     ```
   - The script captures video from the default camera (usually the built-in webcam) and continuously monitors the eye aspect ratio to detect drowsiness.

4. **Termination:**
   - Press the 'q' key to exit the application.

## Parameters

- `thresh`: Threshold value for detecting drowsiness based on EAR.
- `frame_check`: Number of consecutive frames below the threshold before triggering the alert.
  
Feel free to adjust these parameters based on your specific use case and environment.

## Notes

- The script uses the facial landmarks provided by the dlib library to calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).
- When drowsiness is detected, an alert message is displayed on the video feed, and an alert sound is played.
- The Pygame library is used for sound alerting. Ensure that the sound file is accessible, and the mixer is properly initialized.
